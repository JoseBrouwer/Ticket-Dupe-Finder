# Python Script for Finding Duplicate Phone Numbers in CSV
This repository contains a Python script that helps you identify and group phone numbers associated with multiple ticket IDs in a CSV file.

# Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- pandas library 
    - `pip install pandas`

# Running the Script:
Simply run the `find_dupes.bat` file (if on windows). This will ensure that pip is installed and at its latest version and that pandas is installed as well.
-  If you run into any errors, read the output to determine the issue. When initially running file windows may run into issues updating pip and then installing pandas immediately after.
    - A second run installed all dependencies flawlessly.
    - Ensure you have a version of Python3 installed.
